# ratatui-recipe
Async framework for Rust's TUI library, [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui), because the other one doesn't work.

> This project is still in very early development. Check back later for more updates.

This project largely is based on [ratapp](https://github.com/Nekidev/ratapp). In its early state, this project is essentially a 1-to-1 clone of ratapp.
